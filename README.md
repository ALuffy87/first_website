# How to git push and commit

Firstly, when I am in the correct folder, I type git status.

- git status

This shows the red files which are not commited, and the green files which are.

- git add .

This adds all the files to the commit

- git commit -m "Your message "

This adds a little message to the commit

- git push

This pushes the files up to the branch.
